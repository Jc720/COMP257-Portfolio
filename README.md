COMP257/ITEC657 Data Science Portfolio 
===

Hello, my name is Jason Cox,

This repository serves as the basis of several assignments done for COMP257 at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. 

There are 3 portfolio projects consisting of:

1. Analysis of CSV data for cycling
2. Replication of a research paper on residental energy consumption
3. Analysis of KMeans Clustering algorithm

#1 Analysis of CSV data
==

This analysis was undertaken to use data manipulation via Pandas Data Frames on cycling data, as-well as implement other libraries. The data involved was gathered from cycling, it contained several variables and 3 different workout types. The data was provided in CSV format. It was converted into several dataframes to be used for statistical analysis and exploration.



#2 Replication of a research paper on residental energy consumption
==

The second portfolio was themed around reproducibility in science. The analysis was centred around a paper produced by Luis M. Candanedo, VÃ©ronique Feldheim, Dominique Deramaix. In which they were predicting the energy use of appliances in a low-energy house. The paper was sourced from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.083

#3 Analysis of KMeans Clustering algorithm
==

This portfolio implemented the process of the KMeans clustering algorithm on randomly generated data. Visualisation was used to show how KMeans works in a detailed way. Within it, all steps are shown to the algorithm.
